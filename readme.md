Problem Statement:
To build a classification methodology to determine whether a person defaults the credit card payment for the next month. 

Dataset Information: 
ID: ID of each client 
LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual  and family/supplementary = credit) 
SEX: Gender (1=male, 2=female) 
EDUCATION: (1=graduate school, 2=university, 3=high school, 4=others,  5=unknown, 6=unknown) 
MARRIAGE: Marital status (1=married, 2=single, 3=others) AGE: Age in years 

PAY_0: Repayment status in September 2005 (-1=pay duly, 1=payment delay for one month, 2=payment delay for two months, â€¦ 8=payment  delay for eight months, 9=payment delay for nine months and above) 
PAY_2: Repayment status in August 2005 (scale same as above) PAY_3: Repayment status in July 2005 (scale same as above) 
PAY_4: Repayment status in June 2005 (scale same as above) 
PAY_5: Repayment status in May 2005 (scale same as above) 
PAY_6: Repayment status in April 2005 (scale same as above) BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May 2005 (NT dollar) BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September 2005 (NT dollar) 
PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May 2005 (NT dollar) PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April 2005 (NT dollar) Default payment next month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
Tools Used: 
Python programming language and frameworks such as NumPy, Pandas,  Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are used to build the whole model.
Architecture:






Conclusion:
The best model to predict whether user defaults on their credit card payment is determined which can helps banks to take necessary actions and can assist in risk mitigation associated with the default and avoid the loss .The UI is user friendly where they have to just enter details and can obtain results
